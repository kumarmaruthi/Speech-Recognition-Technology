# Speech-Recognition-Technology
Python offers powerful libraries like SpeechRecognition and PyAudio to implement speech recognition. These tools allow users to convert spoken language into text effortlessly. By capturing audio, processing it, and utilizing machine learning, Python applications can enable voice commands, transcription, and accessibility features.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to install Python, set up the environment, and run your speech recognition code.

Step 1: Install Python
1. Download Python**:
   Go to the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   Download the latest version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. Install Python**:
   Run the downloaded installer.
   Check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” during installation.
   Click “Install Now” and follow the prompts.

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal**:
   For Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
   For macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal application.

2. Install Libraries**:
   Type the following commands to install the required libraries:
   
     pip install SpeechRecognition
     pip install PyAudio
   
   If you encounter issues installing PyAudio, refer to its documentation for specific installation instructions related to your OS.

Step 3: Set Up Your Code

1. Open a Code Editor**:
   Use any code editor you prefer, such as VSCode, PyCharm, or even a simple text editor like Notepad.

2. Create a New Python File**:
   Save a new file with a `.py` extension, for example, `speech_recognition.py`.

3. Copy Your Code**:
   Paste the provided speech recognition code into the file.

Step 4: Run Your Code

1. Connect a Microphone**:
   Ensure your microphone is connected and working. Test it with another application if necessary.

2. Open Command Prompt or Terminal**:
   Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python file. Use the `cd` command:
   
     cd path\to\your\file  # For Windows
     cd path/to/your/file  # For macOS/Linux
   

3. Run the Python File**:
    Execute the following command:
   
     python speech_recognition.py


4. Speak When Prompted**:
   When the program says "Listening... Please speak something," talk into the microphone. The program will convert your speech to text and display it.

Step 5: Troubleshooting
  If you encounter errors, ensure:
  Your microphone is set as the default recording device.
  The required libraries are installed correctly.
  You have an active internet connection for the Google Speech Recognition API.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully set up and run a speech recognition application using Python on your computer. Enjoy experimenting with voice commands and speech-to-text functionality!
